ID3 to unicode converter
==============

Converter for mp3 tags into unicode in utf8 format. 

Python code is copied from https://code.google.com/p/id3-to-unicode/. Slight adjustment are made to make it work with current EyeD3 API.

It worked for me at least once. Most likely it's quite buggy after my quick changes. Feel free to fork and update it for your needs.
